For porting over sustainability consultancy marketplace codes  
Create a digital platform that serves as a one-stop sustainability consultancy marketplace tailored for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This platform will onboard a curated network of sustainability consultants with diverse skills and experience across various domains—such as ESG reporting, carbon footprint analysis, energy efficiency, sustainable supply chain management, green certifications, climate risk, and more.

SME customers can log in, describe their sustainability-related needs (via form, chatbot, or guided questionnaire), and be instantly matched with the most suitable consultant or team of consultants based on expertise, availability, industry fit, and project scope. The platform facilitates end-to-end engagement—from needs assessment and consultant matching to proposal submission, project execution, and feedback/review.

Additional features can include:

Tiered pricing and service packages
Marketplace for ready-made sustainability toolkits and templates
Subscription options for ongoing sustainability support
Integration with reporting frameworks (e.g., GRI, TCFD, IFRS S1/S2)
Dashboards for both consultants and SME users to track progress and impact
The goal is to make high-quality sustainability expertise easily accessible, affordable, and actionable for SMEs—while also creating a thriving ecosystem for sustainability professionals to reach new clients and collaborate effectively.
